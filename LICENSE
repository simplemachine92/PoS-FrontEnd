    MIT and their "position of neutrality" in relation to the prosecution of Aaron Swartz, as well as their subsequent defense of their position, are examples of heinous indifference and greed.

    This license has been besmirched by the actions of a greedy corporation, which parades itself as a "university", that supposedly fosters creative application of technology, but clearly, only as long as it serves their own interests.

    "sharing isn't immoral â€” it's a moral imperative. Only
    those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy"
        -- Aaron Swartz


    P.S. Austin is just out here buidling, I'm certain he was only trying to use as open of a license as possible, speedrun ethereum, speedrun ethereum, speedrun ethereum, speedrun ethereum, speedrun ethereum!
